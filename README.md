# Assessing the Economic Impact of the Urban Enterprise Zone Program Reform

The New Jersey Department of Community Affairs (NJDCA) has overseen a major revamp of the Urban Enterprise Zone (UEZ) Program, including the reintroduction of Zone Assistance Funds (ZAF) in 2021 to stimulate economic activity in designated zones. Understanding the impact of this reform is critical for evaluating the program’s effectiveness and informing future policy decisions.

## A. Research Objective

This study, conducted by Rutgers Economics Labs, aims to analyze the economic impact of the UEZ Program reform on key indicators such as employment, unemployment, and income levels across municipalities. A difference-in-differences (DiD) framework will be employed, with UEZ municipalities serving as the treatment group and comparable non-UEZ municipalities as the control group. We will leverage multiple pre‐reform years (when possible) to establish robust baselines and account for the extraordinary circumstances of 2020 (COVID‐19). The study will provide both short‐run results (immediately following the 2021 reintroduction of ZAF) and insights into potential long‐term trends. A previous assessment of the UEZ program, conducted in 2019, can be found here for reference: [2019 UEZ Program Assessment](https://www.nj.gov/dca/uez/pdf/New-Jersey-Urban%20Enterprise-Zone-Program-Assessment-2019.pdf).

## B. Method

### Graphical depiction of trends
- Plot time-series trends for employment, unemployment, and income in each UEZ municipality of interest (Lakewood, Jersey City, Paterson, Newark) and their matched non-UEZ counterparts.
- Overlay pre and post-ZAF reintroduction trends to visually inspect whether treatment and control municipalities exhibited similar trends before 2021.
- Include event study plots that show whether the effects emerge immediately after 2021 or gradually over time.

### Municipality-specific difference-in-differences analysis
#### Individual difference-in-differences (DiD) estimates:
- Run separate (DiD) regressions for each UEZ municipality (Lakewood, Jersey City, Paterson, and Newark) using their matched non-UEZ control municipalities.

#### Heterogeneity Analysis:
- Assess municipality-specific factors (e.g., industry composition, pre-existing employment trends) to explain variations in treatment effects.

### Aggregated difference-in-differences analysis
- Use a panel regression model with time and municipality fixed effects to compare trends across all UEZ municipalities of interest collectively against their control group.
- Implement a two‐way fixed effects difference-in-differences approach to comparing trends in the treatment group with those in a matched or otherwise comparable set of non‐UEZ municipalities (control group).

**Treatment Group:** Lakewood, Jersey City, Patterson, Newark  
**Control Group:** Non‐UEZ municipalities matched on relevant characteristics (e.g., population size, economic profile) to approximate counterfactual outcomes for UEZ municipalities.

#### Optional: Subgroup analysis for mid-tier and small-tier UEZ municipalities
- Replicate the above analysis for mid-tier UEZ municipalities (Vineland, Elizabeth, Camden) and small-tier UEZ municipalities (Asbury Park, etc.).
- This will help determine whether the program had differential effects based on municipality size and economic conditions.

## C. Data
The study will use publicly available and NJDCA-provided datasets, including:

- [UEZ Economic Indicator Database](https://www.nj.gov/dca/uez/pdf/UEZ_Economic_Indicator_Database.xlsb)
- [Latest labor force data (2024)](https://www.nj.gov/labor/labormarketinformation/assets/PDFs/employ/uirate/lfmth_mun.xlsx)
- [Latest business establishment and jobs data (2023)](https://www.nj.gov/labor/labormarketinformation/assets/PDFs/employ/qcew/mun23.xlsx)

## D. Project Timeline
- **Project start:** Week of February 17
- **Project end:** May 9
- **Meeting frequency:** The team will check in at the frequency that works best for the NJDCA. We propose a biweekly check-in to start.

## E. Deliverables
- **Trends Analysis Report:** Overview of employment, unemployment, and income trends in UEZ and non-UEZ municipalities.
- **Graphical Representations & Data Visualizations:** Time-series graphs and municipality-level comparisons.
- **Statistical Model Outputs:** Regression tables, robustness checks, and key findings.
- **Final Presentation to NJDCA:** Summary of key insights and policy implications.
